                "\n" +
                "Adopting a healthy diet is considered a key factor in reducing the risk of heart attack, and many studies have suggested that including omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids as part of such a diet is particularly beneficial for heart health.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Other studies, however, have questioned the heart benefits of omega-3s, with some suggesting that fish oil supplements - a major source of the fatty acids - do not lower the risk of heart-related events.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Omega-3s are essential fatty acids that the body needs for certain functions, including blood clotting, digestion, muscle activity, and cell division and growth. However, the only way the body can get omega-3 is through the foods we eat.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Fatty fish - such as salmon, trout, tuna, sardines, and anchovies - is a key source of omega-3s, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Other sources include leafy vegetables, walnuts, and some vegetable oils, which normally contain the omega-3 alphalinolenic acid (ALA).\n" +
                "\n" +
                "For this latest study, lead researcher Liana C. Del Gobbo, Ph.D., of the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine in California, and colleagues set out to gain a better understanding of how omega-3s affect heart health.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Specifically, they looked at how omega-3s derived from seafood- and plant-based foods influence the risk of death from heart attack, or myocardial infarction.", "http://cdn1.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/articles/311/311239/omega-3-rich-foods.jpg"));

                "\n" +
                "\"Infection control is a priority for all hospitals to reduce the spread of [bacteria],\" said study author Sae Otani, a master course student at Bunkyo Gakuin University in Japan.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"Gloving is recommended as a barrier protection for health care workers to reduce the risk of contamination during contact with infectious sputum [saliva], urine and body fluids,\" but not changing or removing contaminated gloves carries a high risk of transmitting harmful germs, she noted in a news release from the American Society for Microbiology (ASM).\n" +
                "\n" +
                "For the study, Otani and her colleagues contaminated examination gloves with certain types of bacteria found in hospitals and other health care facilities. They then touched the gloves to a sterilized polypropylene surface. The amount of bacteria on the surface was then measured.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"This study shows that contaminated gloves increase risks of cross-transmission of health care-associated pathogens among health care workers and in the environment,\" Otani said.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"Proper glove use may decrease the risk of health care-associated infections and gloves should be carefully used and removed after use depending on the types of bacteria,\" she concluded.\n" +
                "\n" +

                "\n" +
                "They note that what they have shown in the monkey model mirrors much of what has been observed in studies of humans.\n" +

                "\"We have good news for most people: If you are not pregnant and not at risk of becoming pregnant, you probably don't need to be worried about Zika. But my concern for Zika virus in pregnancy is much higher now than it was 6 months ago.\"\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Zika virus spreads to people primarily via the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito - the same species that spreads dengue and chikungunya. The virus can also be passed on through sexual contact, and a pregnant woman can pass it to her fetus.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "In many people, Zika infection causes no symptoms, while others may suffer a mild illness for a few days, with raised temperature, rash, joint pain, or conjunctivitis (itchy or sore eyes).\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Few people infected with Zika need to go to the hospital, and they very rarely die of it. For this reason, many people may not even realize they are, or have been, infected.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "However, if a woman is infected with Zika when she is pregnant, there is a chance her baby will be born with severe defects, including microcephaly, a condition where babies are born with smaller-than-normal heads and often have smaller brains that may not have developed properly.", "http://cdn1.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/articles/311/311275/blood-fed-mosquito.jpg"));

                "\n" +
                "For example, the pilotless flying machines might offer a cheaper and better way to deliver vaccines. And that could potentially boost vaccination rates in areas that can be difficult to reach now, a new study suggests.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Using a computer model, researchers concluded that sending drones to deliver vaccines in low- and middle-income countries would be cheaper and quicker than by land-based vehicles. Cars and trucks are limited by road conditions and have high fuel and maintenance costs, the researchers said.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"Many low- and middle-income countries are struggling to get lifesaving vaccines to people to keep them from getting sick or dying from preventable diseases,\" said senior study author Dr. Bruce Lee. He is director of operations research at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health's International Vaccine Access Center.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"You make all these vaccines but they're of no value if we don't get them to the people who need them. So there is an urgent need to find new, cost-effective ways to do this,\" he explained in a school news release.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Lee said in many locations, vehicles used to move vaccines aren't always available or reliable.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"Assuming that drones are reliable, are capable of making the necessary trips and have properly trained operators, they could be a less expensive means of transporting vaccines, especially in remote areas. They could be particularly valuable when there is more demand for certain vaccines than anticipated and immunization locations must place urgent orders,\" Lee said.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Currently, drones are being tested for medical supply deliveries in rural Virginia, Bhutan and Papua New Guinea. UNICEF is testing drones to transport lab samples in Malawi.

                "The findings are from an analysis of genes from more than 1,000 people with colon cancer. The links between these five gene mutations were very rare, so further research is needed to confirm if they're actually associated with colon cancer.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "The study authors also concluded that all the major genes that significantly increase the risk of colon cancer have been identified.\n" +

                "\"Our study is the largest ever conducted of the genetics of bowel [colon] cancer, and sets out a detailed map of the disease that could lead us to new ways of treating or preventing it,\" study leader Richard Houlston, a professor of molecular and population genetics at the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said in an institute news release.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"The research closes one chapter in the study of bowel cancer, by concluding that all the major risk genes have now been found. But, it opens another by underlining the importance of tracking down the many missing genetic variations which each have a very small effect alone, but together make the biggest impact on inherited risk,\" he explained.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Every cancer gene that's been found, as well as those genetic variants that may continue to be found, gives researchers new insight into the underlying biology of colon cancer. These discoveries also help to assess people for their risk of colon cancer, Houlston said.\n" +

                "\"This study represents an important contribution to our understanding of the genetics of bowel cancer. It provides a marker of the dramatic progress we have made so far in decoding the inherited risk of the disease, and gives us confidence that the most important risk genes have now been found,\" Paul Workman, chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research, said.\n" +
