                "\n" +
                "Adopting a healthy diet is considered a key factor in reducing the risk of heart attack, and many studies have suggested that including omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids as part of such a diet is particularly beneficial for heart health.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Other studies, however, have questioned the heart benefits of omega-3s, with some suggesting that fish oil supplements - a major source of the fatty acids - do not lower the risk of heart-related events.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Omega-3s are essential fatty acids that the body needs for certain functions, including blood clotting, digestion, muscle activity, and cell division and growth. However, the only way the body can get omega-3 is through the foods we eat.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Fatty fish - such as salmon, trout, tuna, sardines, and anchovies - is a key source of omega-3s, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Other sources include leafy vegetables, walnuts, and some vegetable oils, which normally contain the omega-3 alphalinolenic acid (ALA).\n" +
                "\n" +
                "For this latest study, lead researcher Liana C. Del Gobbo, Ph.D., of the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine in California, and colleagues set out to gain a better understanding of how omega-3s affect heart health.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Specifically, they looked at how omega-3s derived from seafood- and plant-based foods influence the risk of death from heart attack, or myocardial infarction."));

        newsList.add(new News("2", "Contaminated Gloves a No-No in Hospitals", "Health care workers who wear contaminated gloves can transfer bacteria onto hospital surfaces, a new study warns.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"Infection control is a priority for all hospitals to reduce the spread of [bacteria],\" said study author Sae Otani, a master course student at Bunkyo Gakuin University in Japan.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"Gloving is recommended as a barrier protection for health care workers to reduce the risk of contamination during contact with infectious sputum [saliva], urine and body fluids,\" but not changing or removing contaminated gloves carries a high risk of transmitting harmful germs, she noted in a news release from the American Society for Microbiology (ASM).\n" +
                "\n" +
                "For the study, Otani and her colleagues contaminated examination gloves with certain types of bacteria found in hospitals and other health care facilities. They then touched the gloves to a sterilized polypropylene surface. The amount of bacteria on the surface was then measured.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"This study shows that contaminated gloves increase risks of cross-transmission of health care-associated pathogens among health care workers and in the environment,\" Otani said.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"Proper glove use may decrease the risk of health care-associated infections and gloves should be carefully used and removed after use depending on the types of bacteria,\" she concluded.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "The study was presented recently at an ASM meeting in Boston. Research presented at meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal."));
        newsList.add(new News("3", "Diabetes Ups Risk of Heart Attack Death", "People with diabetes are much more likely to die after a heart attack than people without the blood sugar condition, a new study finds.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Researchers included 700,000 people in the study. All of them were hospitalized with a heart attack between January 2003 and June 2013. About 121,000 had diabetes.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Compared to people who didn't have diabetes, those with the disease were 56 percent more likely to die if they had a heart attack caused by a completely blocked coronary artery. If their heart attack was the result of a partially blocked coronary artery, people with diabetes were 39 percent more likely to die, the study found.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"These results provide robust evidence that diabetes is a significant long-term population burden among patients who have had a heart attack,\" said lead researcher Dr. Chris Gale, a consultant cardiologist and associate professor in the School of Medicine at the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"Although these days people are more likely than ever to survive a heart attack, we need to place greater focus on the long-term effects of diabetes in heart attack survivors,\" he added in a university news release.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "An important step is to strengthen the partnership between primary care doctors, doctors who treat heart problems (cardiologists), and doctors who treat diabetes (endocrinologists), Gale said. He added that doctors need to make sure that high-risk patients are getting established medications as effectively as possible.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "This study couldn't show a cause-and-effect relationship. So, researchers now want to figure out exactly why people with diabetes have a higher risk of death after a heart attack.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"We knew that following a heart attack, you are less likely to survive if you also have diabetes. However, we did not know if this observation was due to having diabetes or having other conditions which are commonly seen in people with diabetes,\" Dr. Mike Knapton said. He's an associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, which funded the study.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "The findings highlight the need to find better ways to prevent heart disease in people with diabetes, he said. The study also shows the need to develop new treatments to improve survival after a heart attack for folks with diabetes, Knapton added.\n" +

                "The study was published recently in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health."));

        newsList.add(new News("4", "Drones Could Deliver Vaccines in Developing Countries", "Right now, people often associate the use of drones with warfare. But in the future they could serve humanitarian purposes, such as delivering aid to people in developing countries.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "For example, the pilotless flying machines might offer a cheaper and better way to deliver vaccines. And that could potentially boost vaccination rates in areas that can be difficult to reach now, a new study suggests.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Using a computer model, researchers concluded that sending drones to deliver vaccines in low- and middle-income countries would be cheaper and quicker than by land-based vehicles. Cars and trucks are limited by road conditions and have high fuel and maintenance costs, the researchers said.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"Many low- and middle-income countries are struggling to get lifesaving vaccines to people to keep them from getting sick or dying from preventable diseases,\" said senior study author Dr. Bruce Lee. He is director of operations research at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health's International Vaccine Access Center.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"You make all these vaccines but they're of no value if we don't get them to the people who need them. So there is an urgent need to find new, cost-effective ways to do this,\" he explained in a school news release.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Lee said in many locations, vehicles used to move vaccines aren't always available or reliable.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"Assuming that drones are reliable, are capable of making the necessary trips and have properly trained operators, they could be a less expensive means of transporting vaccines, especially in remote areas. They could be particularly valuable when there is more demand for certain vaccines than anticipated and immunization locations must place urgent orders,\" Lee said.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Currently, drones are being tested for medical supply deliveries in rural Virginia, Bhutan and Papua New Guinea. UNICEF is testing drones to transport lab samples in Malawi. Efforts are underway to use drones to transport blood and essential medications in Tanzania, the researchers noted.\n" +

                "\n" +
                "The findings are from an analysis of genes from more than 1,000 people with colon cancer. The links between these five gene mutations were very rare, so further research is needed to confirm if they're actually associated with colon cancer.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "The study authors also concluded that all the major genes that significantly increase the risk of colon cancer have been identified.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"Our study is the largest ever conducted of the genetics of bowel [colon] cancer, and sets out a detailed map of the disease that could lead us to new ways of treating or preventing it,\" study leader Richard Houlston, a professor of molecular and population genetics at the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said in an institute news release.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"The research closes one chapter in the study of bowel cancer, by concluding that all the major risk genes have now been found. But, it opens another by underlining the importance of tracking down the many missing genetic variations which each have a very small effect alone, but together make the biggest impact on inherited risk,\" he explained.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Every cancer gene that's been found, as well as those genetic variants that may continue to be found, gives researchers new insight into the underlying biology of colon cancer. These discoveries also help to assess people for their risk of colon cancer, Houlston said.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\"This study represents an important contribution to our understanding of the genetics of bowel cancer. It provides a marker of the dramatic progress we have made so far in decoding the inherited risk of the disease, and gives us confidence that the most important risk genes have now been found,\" Paul Workman, chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research, said.\n" +
